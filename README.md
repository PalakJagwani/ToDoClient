Todo, a todo application project is a comprehensive ToDo application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It offers a robust solution for managing personal tasks with features that include user authentication and full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality on ToDo items. The application ensures secure and efficient management of user-specific ToDo lists, providing a seamless user experience across different devices.

Key Features:
User Registration and Login: New users can sign up, and existing users can log in securely.
CRUD Operations on ToDo Items: Users can create new tasks, view their existing tasks, update details of tasks, and delete tasks as needed. Each user's ToDo list is kept private and secure.
Responsive Design: The application is built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring that it works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.
Error Handling and Validation: Robust error handling and input validation are implemented to enhance user experience and security.


Technical Stack:
Frontend: The frontend is built with React, providing a modern and dynamic user interface. Tailwind css is used for responsive design and styling.
Backend: The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js, which handle API requests, authentication, and data processing.
Database: MongoDB is used as the database, with Mongoose managing the data schema and interactions.
Authentication: The application uses bcrypt for password hashing and JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication and session management.
HTTP Requests: Axios is used to make HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend API, facilitating data retrieval and updates.
Application Functionality:
User Authentication: The application supports user registration and login. User passwords are hashed for security.
Create ToDo Items: Users can add new ToDo items by providing task details through a simple and intuitive form.
Read ToDo Items: The application fetches and displays all ToDo items associated with the authenticated user in a clear and organized list.
Update ToDo Items: Users can update the details of existing tasks, such as changing the task description or marking tasks as completed.
Delete ToDo Items: Users can delete tasks they no longer need, keeping their ToDo list up-to-date.
How It Works:
User Registration/Login: Users can sign up for a new account or log in to an existing account.


Adding Tasks: Authenticated users can add new tasks to their ToDo list. The tasks are sent to the backend API, where they are stored in the MongoDB database.

Viewing Tasks: Users can view their tasks, which are retrieved from the database and displayed in the user interface. Each task shows details such as the task description and its completion status.

Editing Tasks: Users can update task details through the user interface, and the changes are sent to the backend to update the database.

Deleting Tasks: Users can remove tasks from their ToDo list, with the request sent to the backend to delete the task from the database.

Conclusion:
This MERN stack ToDo application provides a secure and efficient way for users to manage their tasks. With user authentication and full CRUD functionality, it serves as a practical tool for daily task management, demonstrating the power and flexibility of the MERN stack for building modern web applications.
